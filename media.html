###[The New York Times:  Spending Big to Fight Big Donors in Campaigns](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/us/spending-big-to-fight-big-donors.html?_r=1)
>  For context, for the last year Rubens has only raised $588,000 and loaned his campaign another $500,000. Further, Brown has raised $2.6 million for his campaign though he is expected to raise much more and he has his own Super PACs to help his effort.

> The ultimate goal is to reverse a series of defeats that advocates of tighter restrictions on campaign money have suffered since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision.



###[Concord Monitor:  Mayday PAC backs Rubens in Republican U.S Senate primary](http://www.concordmonitor.com/community/town-by-town/concord/12939659-95/mayday-pac-backs-rubens-in-republican-us-senate-primary)
>  A national PAC aimed at curbing the influence of money in politics announced yesterday it will throw its support behind Jim Rubens in the Republican primary race for U.S. Senate.

> “The race is for Scott Brown to lose. We want to make sure this is an issue so there is reason for him to get back on the right side,” Lessig said.

>  It quoted Lessig saying, “Inside-the-Beltway people don’t think this issue matters, they don’t think voters vote on the basis of this issue, and they advise their politicians not to talk about it.”

>  ...I learned that Lessig’s reform plan is not direct public funding, in which taxpayer money goes from the Treasury to campaigns, but indirect. He would rebate $50 in taxes in the form of a “democracy voucher.”



###[BillMoyers.com:  The Super PAC to End Super PACs Gets Started](http://billmoyers.com/2014/07/29/the-super-pac-to-end-super-pacs-gets-started/)

###[UALR Public Radio:  The New SuperPAC That Spends Big So That Others Spend Less](http://ualrpublicradio.org/post/new-superpac-spends-big-so-others-spend-less)
>  The Mayday PAC's goal is to take candidates like Rubens - candidates who are behind in the polls or in close races - and make their support for changing campaign finance a central part of the election. The idea is to prove that this is an issue that can change the way people vote.

> LESSIG: I'm not promising utopia. I'm not promising fixing politics so people love it or want their children to marry politicians. All I'm addressing is a tiny slice, but I think the critical first slice to solve...



###[WMUR ABC Local:  Jim Rubens has biggest day in his U.S. Senate campaign](http://www.wmur.com/political-scoop/jim-rubens-has-biggest-day-in-his-us-senate-campaign/27211912#!brzY6Q)
>  Both candidates have passed Mayday PAC's two-pronged litmus test for support. The informal test requires candidates who might benefit from the super PAC to endorse what Mayday PAC has called "fundamental reform" to campaign finance

> "Voters are fed up to their eye teeth with career politicians who go to Washington to collect campaign cash rather than solving the nations' problems and serving the people they represent," Rubens said.



###[The Washington Post:  The super PAC to end super PACs leaps into New Hampshire and Iowa](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/07/29/the-super-pac-to-end-super-pacs-leaps-into-new-hampshire-and-iowa/)

>  In the New Hampshire Republican Senate primary, the group is supporting state Sen. Jim Rubens over against former Sen. Scott Brown. Brown is most likely to win the primary and challenge Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen

> Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig, one of the founders of Mayday, said in a statement the group chose a Democrat and a Republican to support to send a message.



###[The Boston Globe:  Super PAC to end all super PACs targets New Hampshire Senate race](http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2014/07/29/super-pac-end-all-super-pacs-targets-new-hampshire-senate-race/dXHSkCwK4G7bPeXqCst2rK/story.html)
>  The New Hampshire US Senate race is one of two in the crosshairs of the super PAC to that hopes to end all super PACs.

> The PAC, according to its website, supports Rubens because he supports public financing for elections and an act that would give taxpayers up to $200 vouchers, which would be signed over to the candidate they support.


###[The Gazette:  Super PAC to end super PACs chooses Iowa race](http://thegazette.com/subject/news/politics/super-pac-to-end-super-pacs-chooses-iowa-race-20140729)
>  “We started with these two races to be crystal clear — it doesn’t matter who you are, what your party is, or what powerful friends you have,” Lessig said Tuesday morning. “If you are standing in the way of fundamental reform, if you are supporting what has become a fully corrupt system of money in politics, then you should watch your back.”

> A fact sheet on each candidate’s record on reform can be found online at https://mayday.us/factsheet.



###[Time:  The ‘Super PAC to End All Super PACs’ Is Backing These Candidates](http://time.com/3051449/campaign-finance-mayday-pac/)
>  Mayday PAC has said it will support a total of five candidates in this year’s midterms. However, it has left three of the five candidates it will ultimately support unannounced as a “warning shot,” as the group calls it, to other politicians.

> Mayday PAC says candidates have until 5 p.m. eastern time on August 5 to meet the group’s requirements or else risk being named a target.



###[Vox:  Larry Lessig backs a long-shot Republican in his campaign to clean up money in politics](http://www.vox.com/2014/7/29/5947835/larry-lessig-backs-a-long-shot-republican-in-his-campaign-to-clean-up)
>  Today Lessig announced the first two candidates who will receive support from the Mayday PAC. The choices illustrate just how difficult it is to find credible Republican candidates who will support public financing of elections.

> His campaign needs broad bipartisan support if it's going to overcome the entrenched interests opposing publicly-financed elections. And Rubens may have been the most promising Republican candidate the Mayday PAC could find.



###[Newsmax:  Campaign Finance Reform Groups to 'Fight Money with Money'](http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/campaign-finance-reform/2014/07/29/id/585451/)
>  The groups want to create common ground between liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who agree that big money has become a problem in campaigns. Mayday PAC will back candidates of either party that support reducing the influence of major donors.

> Mayday and other PACS such as Every Voice— which will work the issue on the state level— is not seeking to restrict spending but rather promoting ways to prompt more small donors to enter the fray and in this way lessen the impact of big contributors.


###[Daily Kos:  Mayday PAC's first two candidate choices - Does the left hand know what the right hand's doing?](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/07/29/1317493/-Mayday-PAC-s-first-two-candidate-choices-Does-the-left-hand-know-what-the-right-hand-s-doing)
>  Mayday PAC, which seeks to reform campaign finance by promoting candidates of either party who will support reform legislation to end the overwhelming influence of PAC money in U.S. elections, is faced with the challenge of walking a tightrope in choosing precisely which candidates it will support in 2014.

> In short, with its decision to back Iowa's Appel, Mayday has given liberals some reason to smile upon it. But then there's the little matter of Mayday's other Anointed One, New Hampshire Republican Jim Rubens.


###[Aljazeera America:  Walking for Office - Taking steps (many of them) to counter political cash](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/29/walking-for-office.html)

> ...when Lessig announced plans for the first New Hampshire Rebellion walk — 185 miles in two weeks — in January, Skarin signed up


###[Kelo Radio:  Pressler Calls for Campaign Finance Reform](http://kelo.com/news/articles/2014/jul/29/pressler-calls-for-campaign-finance-reform/)
>  Pressler praised Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig for continuing the fight for campaign reform when many others have just given up or just washed their hands of it.

> A second idea that Harvard Professor Lessig has put on the table has been by George W. Bush’s ethics czar, Richard Painter, which would be called the Taxation Only with Representation Act, which would give every voter a $200 voucher to fund small campaigns.



###[The Guardian:  The problem with the Koch brothers isn't their politics. It's their copycats](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/28/problem-koch-brothers-mega-donors)
>  According to Gallup, fully 50% of the country would support a federally funded campaign finance system with no private contributions whatsoever; 79% would vote for a law limiting contributions in some way.

> Lawrence Lessig – who launched Mayday Pac to blow up big money in politics by raising big money – just surpassed his initial fundraising goal of $5m by raking in $7.6m in small donations.



###[Washington Post:  Larry Lessig’s super PAC to end super PACs raised $2.5 million in just 2 days. Here’s what comes next.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/07/07/larry-lessigs-super-pac-to-end-super-pacs-raised-2-5-million-in-2-days/)
> With more than 50,000 contributors, the average donation works out to about $140. No matter what side you're on when it comes to campaign finance, this was a triumph of grassroots organizing, with small donations leading the way.

> First it has to convince people that campaign finance is an issue worth voting on at all. Then it has to persuade people to vote its way.



###[Daily Kos:  Mayday PAC Speaks: “Nothing guaranteeing [we] will spend the money as we have committed to"](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/07/08/1312531/-Mayday-PAC-Speaks-Nothing-guaranteeing-we-will-spend-the-money-as-we-have-committed-to)
> On their face, these are mostly soothingly reassuring answers...But at their heart, these assurances are all of the "oh, you can trust us" variety.

###[Roll Call Opinion: Reforms May Fade, but Voter Anger Won’t](http://blogs.rollcall.com/beltway-insiders/reforms-may-fade-but-voter-anger-wont/?dcz=)
> But the latest campaign finance push, however impractical or constitutionally suspect, has tapped a well of voter anger that politicians ignore at their peril. Public disgust with Congress, which according to Gallup now enjoys a record-low 7 percent approval rating

> Some campaign finance experts cast the uphill amendment drive as an ill-advised distraction from more pragmatic changes. Lessig’s Mayday PAC, for one, is focused not on amending the Constitution but on such changes as matching small-dollar donations with public funding



###[The Daily Beast: George Takei Sets Phasers to Reform](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/15/george-takei-sets-phasers-to-reform.html)
> “I’m a person who believes in the ideal of one man, one vote—a true democracy, as opposed to a plutocracy where lobbyists can control the result of an election with their money, so I support campaign finance reform,” he said.



###[MSNBC: ‘Super PAC to end all super PACs’ rakes in donations](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/lawrence-lessig-super-pac-rakes-donations)
> Lessig has stressed that the group is non-partisan, and its rhetoric calls out the corrupting influence of money on both parties. Still, given the difficulty of finding Republicans who are willing to commit to genuine campaign finance reform, it seems likely that Mayday would mostly support Democrats.



###[Huffington Post: Senate Dems Step Up to Take On Two Outrageous Supreme Court Decisions](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pearl-korn/senate-dems-step-up-to-ta_b_5587186.html)
> In the final hours of the most recent FEC reporting period, 51,533 donations came in to this PAC, totaling over $6.2 million, which has helped Mayday secure a grand total of over $12 million in its coffers.

###[Truth Out: Crowdsourcing Our Way Out of the Crisis of Democracy](http://truth-out.org/news/item/24971-crowdsourcing-our-way-out-of-the-crisis-of-democracy)
> Have we reached that point? Many think so.  A recent poll found 74% of Americans agree the broken political system needs to be fixed first.

> Lessig...met the first hurdle this week when he raised $12 million for his ‘PAC to end all PACS.’ Now he has to show the campaign can elect politicians who will effectively confront the problem. The plan is for the tactic to grow in the next election after testing it in 2014.

> But with mere days to go Lessig was millions of dollars short of his goal. Then George Takei got involved.

> Lessig, who has far less campaign experience than Rove, needs to win a lot more races while spending a lot less money than American Crossroads. And for his plan to work — for 2014 to be the proof of concept Lessig needs for the massive push he envisions in 2016 — he needs to win those races convincingly.



###[VOX: 68% of Americans think elections are rigged](http://www.vox.com/2014/7/14/5898365/68-of-americans-think-elections-are-rigged)
> A new Rasmussen poll finds that 68 percent of Americans think elections are rigged in favor of incumbents. And they're basically right.

> The term "rigged" might go a tad far. The problem here isn't fraud. In elections, like in so much else, the scandal is what's legal.

> “Eighty-six percent of all voters believe political leaders are more interested in protecting their power than in doing what’s right for the American people.

> Eighty-three percent believe the country is run by an alliance of incumbent politicians, media pundits, lobbyists, and other interests for their own gain.

> Hundreds marched in the New Hampshire Rebellion organized by Lawrence Lessig. In addition to marches to raise awareness, his approach to getting money out of politics includes raising millions to elect candidates that will work to end the ‘rule of money.’

###[Tech President: Lawrence Lessig's Public Q&A on How His $12 million Super PAC Will Fix Campaign Finance](http://techpresident.com/news/25183/lawrence-lessig-12-million-super-pac-fix-campaign-finance)
> The candidates selected will need to take a position on hard issues, like the five outlined at reform.to, which provide concrete plans to create a small donor system for campaign financing: matching citizen contributions and providing voters with vouchers.

> Lessig explained that candidates will be held accountable by committing to co-sponsoring a reform on campaign finance. The reason, said Lessig, is “if you get a majority of members [of Congress] who sponsor a piece of legislation, you have a tool to leverage that legislation on the floor."



###[ON the Media (RADIO INTERIVEW): The Super PAC to End Super PACs](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/super-pac-end-super-pacs/)

> Long story short: the color of Mayday's small-online-donor money is distinctly blue. Actually, this may not be too surprising a result (though it's still worth quantifying): I suspect liberals today tend to feel persecuted by PACs, and probably for good reason, whereas conservatives tend to like rampant big-money-in-politics just fine, thank you very much.

> Money has the potential to commodify everything we value. It eats the human commons. Not only is its heedless pursuit wrecking the planet, it is devouring all that remains of American democracy.

> Pushing back against this possibility is MaydayPAC, founded by Harvard Law School professor, author and long-time activist Lawrence Lessig.



###[Motherboard: Five Candidates the Internet's Favorite Super PAC Should Spend Its Money On](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/five-candidates-the-internets-favorite-super-pac-should-spend-its-money-on)
> Mayday PAC explicitly says it wants to select five races that are tight enough so that it can claim that its campaign finance reform agenda made an impact. That's where things get tricky. For one thing, most Congressional races aren't even competitive, as Derek Willis notes at The Upshot, and the vast majority of incumbents win reelection. For another, campaign finance reform is not top-of-mind when most voters go to the polls...

> Lessig wants to change that.


###[Sacramento News and Review: Small money strikes back with the 99Rise movement](http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/small-money-strikes-back-with/content?oid=14008309)
> That’s why the “small money” proposals for public funding of elections put forward by Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig are so intriguing. Lessig suggests government-matching funds for candidates who rely on small donors, as well as small individual “vouchers” for voters to give to the candidates of their choice.

> Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig believes he’s found a way to fight — and possibly end — superPACs forever. But first, he needs to form a SuperPAC of his own. Lessig talked to Ezra Klein about how big money influences policy, why he launched his own superPAC, and how to make politicians listen — really listen — to ordinary Americans.

> Several years ago, the late internet activist Aaron Swartz had a conversation with one of his mentors, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, that would change Lessig’s future. At the​ time—2007—​Lessig was one of the nation’s top authorities on internet policy and digital copyright law. But at a tech conference in Germany, Swartz challenged Lessig to reevaluate his life's mission.

> “How do you ever think you’re going to make any progress on these issues so long as there’s this corruption in the way our political system works?” Swartz asked, Lessig recalled in a recent interview with Ben Wikler, a radio host and political activist who worked closely with Swartz.

> The mission is simple, if not counterintuitive: Design a super PAC to destroy all super PACs, huge political action committees that allow for unlimited contributions from people, corporations, associations, and unions.

> Politics and money always have been cozy together, but in this new unregulated era, the politics of money may well reign over the politics of the many. We face the prospect of government becoming a vehicle of the wealthy donor class. The inequalities of our economy, which we accept as necessary for capitalism, could become the standard of our democracy.

> The Mayday PAC (mayone.us) is a bold new experiment. Launched May 1, the first-round goal was to raise $1 million from ordinary Americans in one month. Nearly 13,000 individuals contributed more than $1 million in 13 days.

> Both Lifshin and Olds said the Mayday site was saved so quickly by high-caliber engineers who worked for free because many engineers care deeply about open source and support Lessig. The Harvard Law School professor is a well-known political activist who in addition to fighting for campaign finance reform devotes a lot of time to the issues of copyright and net neutrality.

In response, Lessig transformed his career, ending the work on Internet law that had made him famous and turning his sights on the impossible-seeming fight against money in politics.

> On this wrenching, fascinating episode of The Good Fight, Lessig tells his story, lays out his plan, and explains how Mayday emerged from the desperation Lessig felt after Aaron Swartz’s tragic suicide in 2013.

> In an irony-laden crowdsourcing venture called Mayday, web entrepreneurs including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffmann are hoping to solve the “big money problem” in US politics.

> “In 2012, 132 Americans funded 60 per cent of the Super PAC money raised in that election cycle,” Lessig said. “That number will go up in 2014. Imagine it goes up by a factor of 250. Even then, the funders of these Super PACs will represent no more than .01 per cent of America.



###[TechCrunch: Silicon Valley Moguls Push For Campaign Finance Reform](http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/24/silicon-valley-moguls-push-for-campaign-finance-reform/)
> The industry contributed more than $51.3 million to PACs, parties and candidates, which is not far behind the gas and oil industry’s $56.6 million worth of contributions. Let’s not forget the industry’s role in some major super PACs, such as Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us. And Napster co-founder Sean Parker has been making large political donations for years.

> If Mayday PAC actually focuses as Lessig says on electing candidates based on their campaign finance platforms, it could create reforms in Washington.



###[Newsweek: Mayday PAC - The Super PAC Built to Destroy Super PACs](http://www.newsweek.com/new-super-pac-aims-bring-down-super-pacs-256003)
> According to Lessig, Silicon Valley is uniquely positioned to change the power of wealth in American politics. Unlike the finance or energy industries, Silicon Valley has yet to mature to the point where it seeks to boost profit through legislative reforms.

> In some sense, Mayday’s approach seems paradoxical: taking money from one major industry and pitting it against another (the devil you know, and all that). But as Lessig points out, Mayday isn’t aimed specifically at pro-Silicon Valley legislation, like that pertaining to visas or net neutrality. “That wouldn’t be a very principled or interesting PAC,” he says. “The only thing the Mayday PAC is trying to do is get legislation passed to change the way elections are funded.”



###[Latest.com: Harvard Professor Creates Crowdfunded Super PAC to Destroy Super PACs](http://latest.com/2014/06/harvard-professor-creates-crowdfunded-super-pac-to-destroy-super-pacs/)
> According to an interview with VICE, Lessig was one of the people behind the publication of the Congressperson’s daily schedule, which blocked out four hours per day for fundraising. Lessig said, “members of Congress were like, ‘What the hell? Why am I here? I didn’t want to become a telemarkter.’”

> In fact, Lessig says this is why the latest Congress has been the most unproductive of our history, because while it is very difficult to pass legislation, it can be very easy to block it. The corruption doesn’t come in these legislators writing bills for their donors – that’s what lobbyists do – it is in their ability to block legislation their donors don’t like.

###[Talking Points Memo: Launching A Super PAC To Fight Super PACs](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/launching-a-super-pac-to-fight-super-pacs)
> The core problem with our democracy today is that we have outsourced the funding of campaigns to the tiniest fraction of the 1 percent. As congressmen spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time raising campaign cash, they focus their efforts on no more than 150,000 Americans.

> The cost of the 2014 pilot was estimated at $12 million. And so on May 1, we launched an experiment to see whether we could raise money through a Kickstarter campaign for at least half. We set an initial goal of $1 million in 30 days. Insiders thought this was impossible, but with the help of 13,000 supporters, with a median contribution of just $50, we crossed the $1 million mark in 13, not 30, days.

The march departed Los Angeles on May 17, 2014 and will arrive in the state capital, Sacramento, on June 22 with plans to occupy the Capitol building if their demands are not met.  As they march through central California, they combat disempowerment by speaking practically about what can be done to get money out of politics.

> The story of how a young programmer named Aaron Swartz convinced celebrated academic Lawrence Lessig that no political progress could be made without first reforming campaign finance is now part of Silicon Valley lore. In May, Lessig launched a radical initiative to address the issue: MAYDAY, a SuperPAC that secured funding from two Silicon Valley billionaires in order to curtail the influence of big money.

> "It makes me sick to imagine the amount of time [presidential candidates] spend raising money, but the institutional [issue] we have to do something about quite dramatically is Congress. Because Congress is increasingly an institution that spends all of its time in the business of raising money as opposed to the business of trying to figure out what the right thing to do is."



###[Policy Innovations: Of Moonshots and Slingshots](http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/commentary/data/000282)
> Is it still possible for a government to move against the market to favor society? The May Day PAC established by Lawrence Lessig takes the stance that U.S. electoral politics are entirely controlled by corporate interests due to the realities of campaign financing: Politicians who do not attract lavish spending by corporations and wealthy individuals simply cannot succeed under the current rules.

> The situation may be considerably more complex than that (the Republican-Democrat split in America is as much cultural as political), but legitimate questions can certainly be asked about the ability of the U.S. government to go against U.S. business interests.



###[The Atlantic: Campaign-Finance Reform Has to Be Cross-Partisan](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/campaign-finance-reform-has-to-be-cross-partisan/372983/)
> The vast majority of Americans—more than 90 percent in recent polls—believe it “important” to “reduce the influence of money in politics.” But is the business model of the reformers actually consistent with winning reform?

> This is the fair but hard question raised by the strategy planned by Senate Democrats this summer to force a vote on New Mexico Senator Tom Udall’s proposed constitutional amendment to give Congress the power “to regulate the raising and spending of money” in elections. Forty-three Senate Democrats have cosponsored the resolution. Zero Republicans have. Zero is the same number of Republicans who have joined any of the proposed constitutional amendments now floating about in Congress to, as they are described, “reverse Citizens United.”

> This week, Salon called up Lessig in order to discuss some of the details of the Mayday PAC and the vexing problem of money and democracy in America more generally. We also touched on Eric Cantor’s recent shocking defeat and how inequality causes political polarization. Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.

> The aim of the super PAC is to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016. Fundamental reform in the way elections are funded. To do that, we want to run a pilot in 2014 in five districts to demonstrate that this issue matters to voters and to put Congress on notice in 2016 that we’ll be back in a much bigger way.

> Elected officials are so dependent on raising this cash that they have become "shape shifters," in the words of Harvard Law professor Larry Lessig: "They constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money."

> And more. They’ve even got the backing of some rich people. On May 1, Lawrence Lessig, director of the Edmond J. Safra Center on Ethics at Harvard, launched the Mayday PAC, which is a super PAC to end all super PACs.



###[Seacoast Online: We voters have more power than we realize](http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20140614-OPINION-406140305)
> Be encouraged! Even though 96 percent of voters agree that money is a problem in politics (they're right), 91 percent don't believe it can be fixed (they're wrong). We voters have more power than we think we do! On Tuesday, a congressional primary race in Virginia was won by a newcomer to politics who raised just over $200,000 for his campaign. His losing opponent (the incumbent) raised over $5 million.

> In his book "Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress — and a Plan to Stop It," Lawrence Lessig proposes nonpartisan plans to end it. It's a 300-page book, but let me wet your appetite with one paragraph from page 266. "First, we convert the first $50 dollars that each of us contributes to the Federal Treasury into a voucher. Call it a 'democracy voucher.' Each voter is free to allocate his or her democracy voucher as he or she wishes. Maybe $50 to a single candidate. Maybe $25 each to two candidates. Maybe $10 each to five candidates. The only requirement is that the candidate receiving the voucher must opt into the system.



###[Huffington Post: To End School Shootings, Tackle Government Corruption](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charlotte-hill/to-end-school-shootings-gun-control_b_5489209.html)
> But the sad reality is that we're not going to get more gun control until we've fixed a deeper, more pervasive problem: political corruption. I'm not talking about "money exchanged under the table" corruption, but rather what Harvard Professor Larry Lessig terms "dependence corruption" -- the totally legal dependence that our elected officials have upon the powerful interests that make (and, crucially, break) their campaigns.

> This is the cold, hard reality: Any member of Congress who supports gun control legislation today faces a tidal wave of NRA money aimed squarely at kicking them out of office. In the 2012 federal election cycle, the NRA spent nearly $20 million to defeat politicians -- both Democrats and Republicans -- who voted in favor of gun regulations, and to elect politicians who championed unfettered access to guns.

> Larry Lessig's MAYDAY.US. And, yes, we already wrote about this at the beginning of May when the first phase launched, and again when it hit the $1 million goal -- and then secured the second million in matching funds. However, the project has now moved into phase two, where the goal is to raise (and match) $5 million, instead of just $1 million. Already it's around half a million dollars, so there's a long way to go, but it's a good start.

> And, once again, the goal here is to raise this total of $12 million ($1 million + $1 million match in May, and then $5 million + $5 million match in June) as a test for a much larger effort. I've seen too many overly cynical folks say "$12 million isn't enough to change politics." And you're right. But that's not the goal. This is $12 million to be used in specific races as a proof of concept for a much larger moonshot.

The performance is a benefit for Mayday PAC, a group begun by Lessig and GOP media strategist Mark McKinnon in hopes of raising $12 million that could be used to target candidates opposed to inhibiting the political influence of wealthy donors.

> Palmer, who has a wildly devoted following, used the crowd-funding website Kickstarter to raise $1.2 million to finance her last CD and tour. Mayday PAC already has some deep-pocketed patrons, including TED curator Chris Anderson, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Brad Burnham, managing partner of Union Square Ventures, which has funded the likes of Twitter, Kickstarter, and Tumblr.

> Harvard law professor and public intellectual extraordinaire Lawrence Lessig has a bold idea: raising money in order to take money out of politics. He's here to answer your questions about his plan to start a super PAC with the express purpose of destroying super PACs, and saving democracy.

> "We want to spend big money to end the influence of big money," Lessig has said. "Ironic, I get it. But embrace the irony. Because with enough of us, we can easily build a Super PAC bigger and more effective than the Super PACs of the billionaires."

> “Impossible.” As the Army used to say, “The difficult we do immediately, the impossible takes a little longer.” And while we’re not opposed to impossible campaigns, we believe it critical that this movement to “restore democracy” also try the merely “difficult.” For long before two-thirds of Congress will propose an amendment to the Constitution and three-quarters of the states will ratify it, Congress could radically change the way campaigns are funded, through a simple majority vote.

> This is the hard work that Congress should do. It’s easy to hold hearings on resolutions that everyone knows will fail. It takes leadership to force debate on ideas that no one believes can pass—but must pass. That’s the leadership that Lyndon Johnson demonstrated, both in the Senate in 1957, and as President, when he forced a reluctant South to finally accept equal rights. That’s the leadership that this nation needs again, but that, in the grandstanding of D.C. partisanship, seems truly “impossible.”


###[CNN: What I'm reading: The core problem with our democracy](http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/09/what-im-reading-the-core-problem-with-our-democracy/)
> “[T]his, we believe, is the core problem with our democracy today: that we have outsourced the funding of campaigns to the tiniest fraction of the 1 percent,” write Lawrence Lessig and Mark McKinnon in the Daily Beast. “As members of Congress spend between 30 percent and 70 percent of their time raising campaign cash, they focus their efforts on no more than 150,000 Americans – 0.05 percent of the population, about the same number who are named Lester. And for SuperPACs, the numbers are even tinier. In the 2012 election cycle, 132 Americans contributed 60 percent of the SuperPAC money spent in all races. Congress has become dependent upon this tiny slice of the 1 percent, but in no conceivable way does this tiny fraction represent America.”

> There’s too much money in politics, right? Lawrence Lessig has a new plan to solve an old problem. He wants to end money’s outsize influence on the political process, which subverts democracy and drowns out the masses to do the bidding of the well-to-do few.

> Campaign finance reform comes down to arguing about who gets to decide who gets to be umpire of a game which is, at its core, rigged. And it’s rigged in favor of the rich. Electoral politics is mostly cage matches in the gladiator arena they use to distract us. It’s the circus, and entitlements are the bread.

> Big money flowing into our elections is moving us ever further from Lincoln’s ideal: government of the people, for the people and by the people. This problem is not new, but what had been a tide is becoming a flood. With each campaign, our elected officials grow more dependent on big donations from special interests and less dependent on us, their constituents.

> We’ve reached a tipping point for reform. The Great Recession that began in 2007 exposed government and private institutions as deeply flawed and unable to protect ordinary people. The Supreme Court, contrary to common sense and the beliefs of most Americans, has declared that corporations are people and that enormous spending by a billionaire on politics is speech legally equivalent to actual speech by an ordinary citizen.

> Lessig and other leaders of this fight acknowledge it is a tough one. But they have reminded me that when millions of Americans across the political spectrum get riled up and demand change, Congress will listen and will act, and in due course, so will the Supreme Court.

> The Mayday PAC, set up to fight the influence of big money in politics, has raised a lot of money from small donors...but it has also raised more than $1 million (and hopes to raise at least $5 million more) from a few large donors. The large donors, many of them tech entrepreneurs, are matching funds raised in smaller chunks.

> If successful, Mayday PAC would go from inception to a war chest of over $12 million in just 60 days. That money will then fund campaigns in five congressional districts yet to be announced, targeting candidates that oppose campaign finance reform. It is part of a two election cycle plan to hold candidates accountable to voters on the issue of money in politics and win a Congress committed to enacting campaign finance reform by 2016. If successful in the 2014 cycle, the effort would be expanded for the 2016 elections.

> This experimental new effort will show that regular people are deeply motivated to demand changes that loosen the grip of big money on politics and government. People “commit” by pledging a contribution anywhere between $5 and $10,000, and their commitment is collected only if the Mayday PAC reaches its fundraising target by its deadline.



###[Politico: Mayday PAC secures matching pledges](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/mayday-pac-secures-matching-pledges-107398.html?hp=l6)
> The PAC raised $1 million in grass-roots donations in its first 13 days in existence and has now set a $5 million target by July 4. If Mayday PAC reaches that goal, Lessig and McKinnon have lined up the support of a handful of wealthy donors — mostly from Silicon Valley — to kick in an additional $5 million in matching funds.

> If the renewed push is successful, the PAC would have a $12 million war chest for the 2014 cycle. Though that is a modest sum in the world of big-money politics, the PAC would invest in five targeted congressional races. The campaigns have yet to be announced or determined.

But since I suspect most readers are pretty skeptical at this point, let me take you through the completely hard-boiled, non-utopian case for supporting the project, which roughly amounts to the following: Mayday, or something like it, turns out to be our last best hope for reducing the massively outsized influence of the 1 percent over public policy.

> I arrive at this conclusion by way of some simple armchair-Marxist analysis, which holds that no significant reform can happen unless some very powerful, very rich interest group decides it has a stake in it.

> "The influence of big money over our political process is worse than it's ever been, and it's evident from the complete dysfunction in Washington," said Professor Lawrence Lessig. "Mayday PAC's success will prove that there are enough people willing to invest in sending Congress the message that it is time for fundamental campaign finance reform." Mark McKinnon adds, "We want a government that works for all of us, not simply the wealthy who bankroll campaign contributions and Super PACs."

If people help raise $1 million, with contributions of $10,000 or less, in one month, Lessig said wealthy supporters would kick in another $1 million. The group raised its first $1 million by the middle of May.

> The big supporters providing the matching $1 million include LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman, venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder and president of Thiel Capital Peter Thiel, TED curator Chris Anderson, Union Square Ventures partners Brad Burnham and Fred Wilson, Women's Entrepreneurial Festival co-founder Joanne Wilson, and Schooner Capital founder Vin Ryan.

Washington won’t fix itself, so who else could fix it?

> It turns out the framers of our Constitution thought about this problem precisely. Two days before the Constitution was complete, they noticed a bug. In the version they were considering, only Congress could propose amendments to the Constitution. That led Virginia’s George Mason to ask, what if Congress itself was the problem?

> “In 2016, number one, there will be fewer fights that we have to have, because people will get on the right side of this issue just out of fear,” Lessig says. “And number two, we’ll have a whole bunch of people more interested in investing, because they see a potential return here.”

> “[Vouchers] would radically change the business model of fundraising overnight,” Lessig says. “You would not have candidates spending their time talking to the tiniest fraction of the 1%.

>  Is it possible to create a "super PAC" that would end the power of super PACs by drawing enough Americans into the system to limit the influence of big money in politics? And is it possible to get voters excited about a subject as dry as campaign finance?  Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig is leading a crusade to answer both those questions with a yes.

>  If the Mayday PAC is able to take out five members of Congress this cycle “who are on the wrong side of this issue,” Lessig said, “then when 2016 comes around, magically a whole bunch of members of Congress would be on the right side of this issue, and we would have a narrower range of people that we would have to be going after, and we would have very good data

  a "super PAC to end all super PACs."  Lessig, one of a new breed of campaign
  finance reformers, wants to change the corrupted system by which politicians

> Harvard’s Lawrence Lessig, the crusader for campaign finance reform, feels
  that his fellow reformers don’t think big or boldly enough to inspire the kind
  of grassroots campaign that might break elite donors’ stranglehold on
  America’s political system.

  Atlantic*](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/campaign-finance-and-the-nihilist-politics-of-resignation/360437/),
  Lessig argues that public cynicism about the prospect of deep reform actually
  working is the only thing keeping widespread outrage at our slide toward
  plutocracy in check. And he thinks that only a “moonshot” campaign — an
  ambitious, collective, national effort “unlike anything they’ve seen before” —
  can “crack this cynicism” and usher in a more democratic system.



### <a href="http://time.com/84556/lawrence-lessig-superpac/" target="_blank">Time: Campaign Finance Reformer Launches Super PAC to End Super PACs</a>

> Mayday PAC was already 8 percent of the way toward its goal by Thursday
  afternoon with more than $75,000 pledged and nearly 31 days left to reach its
  target.

> To say Mayday PAC faces an uphill fight is an understatement. Proponents of
  serious campaign finance reform face strong opponents in both parties, and the
  Supreme Court and lower courts have issued rulings in recent years striking
  down or throwing into doubt a wide array of restrictions on political
  spending.

> If the idea behind Mayday PAC sounds absurd, that’s by design. Cynicism and
  defeatism about government run so deep through American politics, Lessig
  believes, that the only way to “crack this cynicism” is with an idea so
  exceedingly ambitious—a “moonshoot,” he calls it—that people might be roused
  to get behind it.
