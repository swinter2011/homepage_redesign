### Biography: 

Ruben Gallego is a former Democratic member of the Arizona House of Representatives, representing District 27 which covers most of South Phoenix. He resigned in March of this year to focus on his Congressional campaign, which he launched following the retirement of United States Representative Ed Pastor. Gallego rose quickly in the state legislature, recently serving as the Assistant Minority Leader.  

Prior to his work as an elected official, Gallego served with the United States Marine Corps in Iraq. Ruben’s history as a marine guided his initial priorities as an elected official, focusing predominantly on issues that related to veterans. 

Rubens is running for Congress to bring a fresh perspective to Washington and help a new generation of leaders emerge on Capitol Hill.

# Why We Chose Ruben Gallego

Gallego supports changing the way elections are funded. In response to a candidate questionnaire conducted by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), Gallego supports establishing a system of elections in which candidates who choose to accept only small donations (below a level around $150) receive matching funds, allowing candidates to spend more time talking to voters and less time calling wealthy out-of-state donors. 

# District Overview

Arizona’s Seventh Congressional District is centered around Phoenix and is entirely within Maricopa County. The district includes Downtown and Central Phoenix, as well as South Phoenix and pieces of Glendale, Tolleson and Guadalupe.

District 7 is one of the most diverse areas in Arizona. More than 60% of the residents are Hispanic and nearly 10% are African-American. Additionally, District 7 is home to 25,000 military veterans.  

According to FairVote and the Cook Political Report, the 7th Congressional District voters tend to favor the Democratic Party, voting to elect President Obama in 2008 and voting against President Bush in 2004.
