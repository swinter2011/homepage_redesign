### New Hampshire Senate -- Republican Primary

{% endcapture %}

{% capture oppblurb %}

Jim Ruben’s primary opponent is former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. Brown is a popular and charismatic politician, originally from Massachusetts. He was a supporter of public funding for elections when he was a state senator in Massachusetts. In his reelection campaign against Elizabeth Warren, Brown embraced the “People’s Pledge." But in this race, he has rejected the People’s Pledge, and gone back on his support for public funding.

# Why We Chose Jim Rubens

We are proud to support Jim Rubens in the New Hampshire Republican primary, a businessman and former state senate Republican, who is confronting openly an issue that too many in his party simply ignore: the corrupting influence of money in politics. Rubens supports a system of voluntary small dollar vouchers to help fund federal elections. His system would radically reduce the influence of special interests in Washington, and help restore a government responsive to the people.

# About New Hampshire

New Hampshire is a fiercely independent state, with a plurality of voters registered as “undeclared” and capable of voting in either primary. Among the nations most engaged citizens politically (thanks to its holding the first presidential primary every four years), with the most representative state assembly (400 representatives for a population of just over 1.3 million), the state has a strong tradition supporting reform. In 2000, the state chose John McCain as the Republican nominee after he made the “corruption in Washington” a central issue in his campaign.
